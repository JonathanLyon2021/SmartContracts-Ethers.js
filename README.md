# SmartContracts-Ethers.js
This is Exercise 13 in MI4 of Kingsland Universities Blockchain Developer Program.

In this exercise, we will use the ethers.js library to interact with a smart contract deployed on the Ethereum Ropsten <br>
Testnet. We will first compile a contract, deploy it and finally invoke some of the contract’s functions once it’s <br>
deployed.<br>

1. Compiling a Smart Contract <br>
The Smart Contract object is a meta-class, so many of its functions are not defined until it is instantiated with an <br>
Application Binary Interface (ABI) which is usually generated by a compiler, such as the Solidity Compiler. Therefore, <br>
we will use the solc-js library – JavaScript bindings for the Solidity Compiler. <br>
To start, create a new project directory in an appropriate place; open a terminal session and initialize a <br>
package.json file inside the project directory: 

    `npm init -y`
    
After that, install solc-js:

    npm install ––save solc@^0.8.10
    
Because we will be reading a smart contract from a file, we will need a file-system library:

    npm install ––save fs-extra@^0.30.0
    
Last but not least, we need to install ethers.js:

    npm install ––save ethers@5.5.1

After we have installed our dependencies, create a JavaScript file called ethers-workflow.js and require them.

Provider links to a running node in order to connect to the Ethereum blockchain for issuing queries and sending
state changing transactions. It is simply a connection to the network. For the purposes of this exercise, we will use
Ropsten as our provider.
Now, we will create a simple smart contract called ArrayOfFacts.sol which will store an array of strings called facts in
the blockchain. Only the owner of the contract can add facts but anyone should be able to get a count of how many
facts there are and retrieve a specific fact by index.

Now that we have written the smart contract, we will create a function in ethers-workflow.js which reads a file and
returns its content.

Let’s now create a function to compile the smart contract: we will create a function called compileContract which
takes two parameters: the file name and the contract name. It will return an output of the compiled contract.

Now, let’s create an async, self-invoking function to execute the program’s logic.

Let’s save a reference to the ABI for later use:
